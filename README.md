##  Thyroid Prediction Model

##  Project Overview
The Thyroid Prediction Model is a machine learning–based system designed to predict whether a person may have a thyroid disorder based on clinical, demographic, and biochemical data. The project also includes a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to easily input patient details and view predictions.

This project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning in healthcare data analysis and decision support systems.
